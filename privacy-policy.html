                        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                        <p>
                            Welcome to OneLens, an iOS camera application developed by BrunchDevelopment. Our utmost priority is your privacy and the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy details how we handle your data when you use our OneLens app.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>2. Data Collection and Usage</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>We do not store or gather any data for any purposes.</strong> Our business model is based on providing data security and an exceptional app experience to our users. We do not engage in advertising or selling user data, as we believe this would undermine security, user trust, and the merit of OneLens.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, to ensure transparency and inform you about how your data is handled during app usage, we provide the following details:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Temporary Local Storage:</strong> Photos and videos captured with OneLens are temporarily stored on your device until they are successfully uploaded to your chosen cloud service. After upload, they are deleted from local storage. You can find this temporary storage in the Files app -> On My iPhone -> OneLens.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cloud Service Data:</strong> OneLens requires full access to your cloud service to upload photos and videos and retrieve thumbnails. It will access only one folder, which you can change. The default folder is named “OneLens.” The app does not store full-size pictures/videos or thumbnails locally after upload.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cloud Service Login and Status:</strong> To function correctly, OneLens stores login status, error messages, and the OneLens destination path for cloud service access.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cloud Service Upload Data:</strong> OneLens reads upload data such as .jpg and .mp4 files to facilitate uploads to your cloud service.</li>
                            <li><strong>GPS Location:</strong> If you opt-in, GPS data is embedded in the metadata of photos and can be displayed as overlays. This data is temporarily stored locally until upload (see Temporary Local Storage). You can opt out by adjusting your device settings under Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Location Services -> OneLens.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>3. Data Security</h3>
                        <p>
                            We implement industry-standard security measures to safeguard your data. Access tokens for cloud services are securely stored in your device's keychain, and media files are promptly deleted from local storage after a successful upload to your cloud service. All data transmissions, including user-captured media, are encrypted and securely transmitted using the HTTPS protocol with TLS (Transport Layer Security), ensuring secure communication with the documented API of the remote service, such as Microsoft OneDrive.
                        </p>                        
                        <h3>4. Sharing of Information</h3>
                        <p>
                            OneLens does not share your personal information with third parties, except as necessary to provide OneLens's services (e.g., uploading media to your chosen cloud service). Once data is uploaded to the user's chosen cloud service, it is subject to that service's privacy policy. We recommend reviewing the privacy policy of your chosen cloud service.
                        </p>
                        <h3>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
                        <p>
                            You will be notified in the OneLens app if we make significant changes that could affect your privacy or rights. Your continued use of OneLens after such changes will constitute acceptance of the new policy.
                        </p>
                        <h3>6. Contact Us</h3>

                        <p>
                            This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the European Union, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
