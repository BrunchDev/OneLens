                        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                        <p>
                            Welcome to OneLens, an iOS camera application developed by BrunchDevelopment.
                            Our utmost priority is your privacy and the security of your personal information.
                            This Privacy Policy explains how your data is handled when you use the OneLens app,
                            including when you enable integrations with third-party cloud services such as Google.
                        </p>

                        <h3>2. Data Collection and Usage</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong>OneLens does not collect, store, or transmit user data to anyone other than the cloud service(s) you explicitly authenticate.</strong>
                            All data processing occurs locally on your device and in direct communication with your chosen cloud provider(s).
                        </p>

                        <p>For transparency, the following data handling practices apply:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Temporary Local Storage:</strong>
                                Media files are stored locally only until uploads complete successfully, after which they are deleted.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Local Thumbnails (Optional):</strong>
                                Low-resolution thumbnails may be stored locally to improve performance.
                                This feature is enabled by default and can be disabled in the app settings.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Cloud Service Data:</strong>
                                OneLens requires file access permissions supported by the selected cloud provider
                                in order to upload media and display content. The app operates only within a single
                                configurable folder (“OneLens” by default).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>GPS Location (Optional):</strong>
                                Location data is used only if explicitly enabled and is embedded directly into media metadata.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            OneLens is a local upload facilitator only. We do not use user data for advertising,
                            analytics profiling, or resale.
                        </p>

                        <h3>3. Google User Data Access</h3>
                        <p>
                            If you choose to connect OneLens to Google services (such as Google Drive),
                            access is granted only after explicit consent via the Google OAuth consent screen.
                        </p>
                        <p>The application may access the following Google user data:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Basic Google account information (email address and account identifier)</li>
                            <li>Google Drive file metadata (file names, IDs, MIME types, sizes)</li>
                            <li>Google Drive file content for files explicitly selected or created by the user</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            OneLens does not access Gmail, contacts, calendars, or any Google data outside the scopes
                            explicitly shown and approved during OAuth authorization.
                        </p>

                        <h3>4. Google User Data Usage</h3>
                        <p>
                            Google user data is used strictly to provide the requested functionality,
                            such as uploading files to your own Google Drive, displaying upload status,
                            and supporting resumable uploads. Google user data is never used for advertising,
                            tracking, analytics, or automated profiling.
                        </p>

                        <h3>5. Data Security & Protection</h3>
                        <p>
                            We apply industry-standard security practices. OAuth access tokens are stored securely
                            on your device (for example, in the system keychain). All communications with cloud services,
                            including Google APIs, are encrypted using HTTPS with TLS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Any temporary server-side data used solely to facilitate upload continuity is retained
                            only for the minimum duration required and is access-restricted.
                        </p>

                        <h3>6. Sharing of Information</h3>
                        <p>
                            OneLens does not sell, rent, or share Google user data or personal information with third parties.
                            Data is shared only with the cloud service you explicitly authorize (such as Google Drive)
                            to perform requested actions. Once uploaded, data is governed by that provider’s privacy policy.
                        </p>

                        <h3>7. Data Retention & Deletion</h3>
                        <p>
                            User data is retained only as long as necessary to provide the requested functionality.
                            Temporary upload data is deleted automatically after completion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Users may request deletion of any application-associated data by contacting us at
                            <span id="contact-email"></span>. Upon request, we will delete remaining data
                            and revoke stored OAuth tokens where applicable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Users may also revoke Google access at any time through their Google Account
                            security settings, which immediately prevents further data access.
                        </p>

                        <h3>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
                        <p>
                            If changes are made that affect how user data is accessed or handled,
                            this policy will be updated accordingly. Continued use of OneLens constitutes
                            acceptance of the revised policy.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the European Union,
