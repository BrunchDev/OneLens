                        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                        <p>
                            Welcome to OneLens, an iOS camera application developed by BrunchDevelopment. Our utmost priority is your privacy and the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy details how we handle your data when you use our OneLens app.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>2. Data Collection and Usage</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong></strong>OneLens does not collect, store, or transmit user data to anyone other than the cloud service(s) you have authenticated. </strong> All data processing occurs locally on your device and in direct communication with your chosen cloud provider(s).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, to ensure transparency and inform you about how your data is handled during app usage, we provide the following details:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Temporary Local Storage:</strong>
                                Media files are stored locally only until upload completes successfully, after which they are deleted.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Local Thumbnails (Optional):</strong>
                                Low-resolution thumbnails may be stored locally to improve performance. This optional feature is enabled by default and can be enabled or disabled in the app’s settings.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Cloud Service Data:</strong>
                                OneLens requires full file access to your cloud service. This level of access represents the minimum permission model supported by cloud providers necessary to upload media and display content in the gallery. The app operates only within a single configurable folder, “OneLens” by default.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>GPS Location (Optional):</strong>
                                Location data is handled only if enabled and is embedded directly in media files.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            OneLens is a local upload facilitator—nothing more. We do not engage in advertising or selling user data, as we believe this would undermine security, user trust, and the success of OneLens.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <h3>3. Data Security</h3>
                        <p>
                            We implement industry-standard security measures to safeguard your data. Access tokens for cloud services are securely stored in your device's keychain, and media files are promptly deleted from local storage after a successful upload to your cloud service. All data transmissions, including user-captured media, are encrypted and securely transmitted using the HTTPS protocol with TLS (Transport Layer Security), ensuring secure communication with the documented API of the remote service, such as Microsoft OneDrive.
                        </p>                        
                        <h3>4. Sharing of Information</h3>
                        <p>
                            OneLens does not share your personal information with third parties, except as necessary to provide OneLens's services (e.g., uploading media to your chosen cloud service). Once data is uploaded to the user's chosen cloud service, it is subject to that service's privacy policy. We recommend reviewing the privacy policy of your chosen cloud service.
                        </p>
                        <h3>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
                        <p>
                            You will be notified in the OneLens app if we make significant changes that could affect your privacy or rights. Your continued use of OneLens after such changes will constitute acceptance of the new policy.
                        </p>
                        <h3>6. Contact Us</h3>

                        <h3>7. Governing Law</h3>
                        <p>
                            This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the European Union, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

                            By using the OneLens app, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and agree to the collection and use of your information as described herein.
